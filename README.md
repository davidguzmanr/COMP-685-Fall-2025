## Papers
- [Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models Are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/33879)

## Datasets
- [Global Biodiversity Information Facility - Search datasets](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search)
- [Global Biodiversity Information Facility - Data Downloads](https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/data-use/importing-gbif-data-into-excel)
- [EOD – eBird Observation Dataset](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e)
    - This dataset could be very useful, since it has the coordinates and time of observation, see the [table](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?dataset_key=4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e&has_coordinate=true&has_geospatial_issue=false&occurrence_status=present)
    - [Best Practices for Using eBird Data](https://ebird.github.io/ebird-best-practices/ebird.html)
    - When downloading this dataset use the "SIMPLE" version, which has all the dataset, we can also use the "CUBE" version to modify the query and do custom aggregations before downloading the data.
- [iNaturalist Research-grade Observations](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7)
    - This dataset could be very useful, since it has the coordinates and time of observation of more species.
    - When downloading this dataset use the "SIMPLE" version, which has all the dataset, we can also use the "CUBE" version to modify the query and do custom aggregations before downloading the data.
